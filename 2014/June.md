###June 26
- [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxVg_s8xAms) on Reactjs is really great. 
-  I am gonna try my hand at making a small prototype for a project that I had been itching to make since quite a while using react in a day or two.

###June 25
- Been spending the last few days learing about Facebook React. Although I was initially put off by the concept of mixing markup with code, after learning about how the framework optimizes it to create a virtual dom and reduce the number of dom reflows, it seems to have a lot of appeal.
- Watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7cQ3mrcKaY) by Pete Hunt in which he talks about the concepts behind react - primarily coupling and cohesion.

###June 15
- Learnt that `git add -u` will only stage the tracked files.
- You can list the names of files in a git branch by `git ls-tree -r <branch_name> --name-only` ( [Ref](http://stackoverflow.com/a/1910822/226953)  )
- You can just checkout specific files from another branch by `git checkout branchname -- filename`  ([Ref](http://stackoverflow.com/a/2364223/226953))
- Created an annotated tag with a very clear purpose for the first time.
- Learnt that git merge can merge multiple branches in a single command. ([Ref](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16208144/how-do-i-merge-multiple-branches-into-master)).
- [Reverting a branch merge](http://lostechies.com/derickbailey/2010/04/01/git-how-to-revert-a-branch-merge/) in git - `git reset --hard HEAD^`. Yes, you can even go wrong with merges.
- Apparently Lodash [is way better](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13789618/differences-between-lodash-and-underscore) than underscorejs.

###June 08
- Spent the whole day configuring and installing ubuntu on my virtual box to work with my mac as per my preferences. Finally wrote a [blog post](http://blog.ryansukale.com/setting-up-an-ubuntu-vm-on-a-mac-for-folder-sharing-but-separate-environments/) about it.

###June 07
- Read up [javascript promises](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/es6/promises/).
