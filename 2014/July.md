###July 06
- Spent a good part of my day learning about some d3js. Tried out the first chapter from the free ebook D3 [Tips and Tricks](https://leanpub.com/D3-Tips-and-Tricks) by Malcolm Maclean.
- Also tried to make simple tree graph from [this blog post](http://www.d3noob.org/2014/01/tree-diagrams-in-d3js_11.html), which is also part of the book. There is probably another interesting article [here](http://blog.pixelingene.com/2011/07/building-a-tree-diagram-in-d3-js/) on creating trees in d3 that I should read.
- [This post](http://knowledgestockpile.blogspot.com/2012/01/understanding-selectall-data-enter.html) explains the concept of the enter() and the data() function excellently. Its a pretty easy read and some really important information.
- Check out [this nifty presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/elHornair/yui-app-framework) of YUI if you are in a hurry.

###July 05
- Learnt a bit about [YUI App framework](https://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/app/). It says its inspired by Backbonejs. Its seems very heavily inspired by it. So much so that it just feels like a different syntactical glue to do the very same thing the YUI way. I guess that helps if you are already familiar with backbone.
