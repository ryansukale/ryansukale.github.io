###July 13
- Found [this nice little grunt configuration](https://gist.github.com/slashdotdash/9102812) to watch for react files.
- Read up a bit about Browserify.
- [This one seems](http://www.thomasboyt.com/2013/12/17/using-reactjs-as-a-backbone-view.html) to contain a nice example as well for using react with backbone and some more links at the end that I did not get a chance to read.
- Continue reading the d3js tips and tricks. This time the graph chapter seemed a lot more easier to understand.


###July 12
- Spent some time today revisiting Reactjs. Also came across a [tutorial series](https://medium.com/react-tutorials) on using react with other frameworks. The one feature that caught my eye was the ability to add [mixins](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reusable-components.html#mixins) to a react component to augment the component lifecycle. 
- Was also reading through D3js tips and tricks.
- Found this [neat cheat sheet](http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/d3-cheat-sheet.pdf) on d3js by Jerome Cukier. It at least makes things a bit more clearer.



###July 06
- Spent a good part of my day learning about some d3js. Tried out the first chapter from the free ebook D3 [Tips and Tricks](https://leanpub.com/D3-Tips-and-Tricks) by Malcolm Maclean.
- Also tried to make simple tree graph from [this blog post](http://www.d3noob.org/2014/01/tree-diagrams-in-d3js_11.html), which is also part of the book. There is probably another interesting article [here](http://blog.pixelingene.com/2011/07/building-a-tree-diagram-in-d3-js/) on creating trees in d3 that I should read.
- [This post](http://knowledgestockpile.blogspot.com/2012/01/understanding-selectall-data-enter.html) explains the concept of the enter() and the data() function excellently. Its a pretty easy read and some really important information.
- Check out [this nifty presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/elHornair/yui-app-framework) of YUI if you are in a hurry.

###July 05
- Learnt a bit about [YUI App framework](https://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/app/). It says its inspired by Backbonejs. Its seems very heavily inspired by it. So much so that it just feels like a different syntactical glue to do the very same thing the YUI way. I guess that helps if you are already familiar with backbone.
